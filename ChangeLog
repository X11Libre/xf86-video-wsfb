	* Makefile.am:
	* autogen.sh:
	* configure.ac:
	* man/Makefile.am:
	* src/Makefile.am:
	Added autoconf related files. Copied from other driver
	so keeping same copyright. The version is 0.1.0 based on
	what was in wsfb_driver.c.

	* src/wsfb_driver.c:
	Renamed VERSION to WSFB_VERSION so doesn't conflict with
	VERSION from new makefile.

	Tested under NetBSD using wsdisplay on vesafb.

	* man/wsfb.man:
	Use __xservername__ macro instead of hardcoding.
	Mention it is for NetBSD also (I tested under NetBSD/i386).
	Add a comment (roff comment) about NetBSD.
	Mention device name for NetBSD.

	* src/wsfb_driver.c:
	NetBSD uses /dev/ttyE?. (Already that way in
	xserver/xorg/hw/xfree86/os-support/bsd/bsd_init.c.)
